# Twitter/X Clone

**_TypeScript, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Prisma, TRPC_**

- For this full stack app, I orchestrated a dynamic database using Prisma and fine-tuned
  interactions through TRPC. Seamlessly linking this database, I crafted a user-centric
  platform allowing tweet creation, likes, user interaction, and seamless following of other
  users.
  -I wanted to build an app that mimiced a real world application to tune my skills in TypeScript and CSS. This app is full-stack and has functionality for following, posting and liking tweets. I followed the design of X in August of 2023 by going on twitter and recreating an acurate design.
  -Leveraging Next.js and Tailwindcss this app is fully responsive. The back-end is built using TRPC and Prisma, linked to a MySql database in Planet Scale. The app has created a great experience that has been embraced by my friends
  and family who can log in and out using discord.
